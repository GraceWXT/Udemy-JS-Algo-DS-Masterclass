# Problem Solving Patterns
## Objective
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

## Frequency Counter
- __Use Objects__ or sets to __collect__ values/frequencies of values (usually originally linear structures like array or strings)
- Avoid the need for nesting loops (O($n^2$) operations) with arrays /strings
