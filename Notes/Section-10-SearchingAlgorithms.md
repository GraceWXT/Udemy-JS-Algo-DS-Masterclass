# Searching Algorithms
## Objectives
- What is a searching algorithm
- Implement linear search on arrays
- Implement binary search on sorted arrays
- Implement a naive string searching algorithm
- Implement the KMP string searching algorithm

## Linear Search
- Built-in array methods: indexOf, includes, find, findIndex...
- Check every single element
- Time Complexity: O(n)

## Binary Search
- only works on sorted arrays
- eliminates half of the remaining elements at a time
- one of the divide and conquer patterns
- Time Complexity: O(${log_2}{n}$)
