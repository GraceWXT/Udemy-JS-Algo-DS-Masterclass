# Problem Solving Approach
## Objectives
- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms

## What
A __process__ or __set of steps__ to accomplish a certain task

## Why
- Almost everything in programming involves some kind of algorithm
- foundation of being a successful problem solver and developer

## How
1. Devise a plan (this section)
2. Master common patterns (next section)

## The Approach
### 1. Understand the problem
  - restate the problem in my own words
  - what are the inputs/outputs
  - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs
  - How should I label the important pieces of data

### 2. Explore concrete examples
  - understand the problem better
  - provide sanity checks
  - User Stories/Units Tests
  - Start with simple, progress to complex
  - Explore with empty/invalid inputs

### 3. Break it down
  - write out the steps you need to take (comments) FIRST

### 4. Solve/Simplify (if can't solve)
  - Find the core difficulty
  - Temporarily ignore the difficulty
  - Write a simplified solution
  - incorporate the difficulty back in

### 5. Look back and refactor
  - can check the result?
  - can derive the result differently?
  - can understand it at a glance?
  - can use the result or method for some other problem?
  - can improve the performance of the solution?
  - other ways to refactor? (style guide, convention, etc)
  - how have other people solve the problem?
