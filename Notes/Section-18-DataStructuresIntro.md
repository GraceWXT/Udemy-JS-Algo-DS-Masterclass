# Data Structures Introduction
## What
- Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

## Why
- Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are mre generally used.

## ES2015 Class Syntax
- Class: A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods
- the `class` keyword creates a constant, so a class cannot be redefined
- the `new` keyword instantiates object from a class
- the `constructor` function is a special function that gets run when the  class is instantiated
- instance methods vs class methods(static)
- In a instance method or constructor, the `this` keyword refers to the instance
