# Quadratic sorting algorithms
## Section 11: Bubble Sort
- Good for nearly sorted data
- Time: worst - O($n^2$), best - O(n)
- Space: O(1)

## Section 12: Selection Sort
- similar to bubble sort, but first places small values into sorted position
- Time: worst - O($n^2$), best - O($n^2$)
- - Space: O(1)
- Less memory (space) taken than bubble because there're less swaps

## Section 13: Insertion Sort
- Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted
- Time: worst - O($n^2$), best - O(n)
- Space: O(1)
- Good at almost sorted data / continuously adding more data to a sorted dataset live
